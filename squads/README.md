## How It Works

1. User runs `npx aiox-core install` and activates Pro license
2. `@aiox-fullstack/pro` npm package is installed
3. Scaffolder copies all squads from this directory into the user's project `squads/`
4. Agent commands are auto-installed into active IDEs (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Cursor)
5. CI validates package and README coverage before the sync PR to `aiox-core`

## Adding New Squads

1. Develop in `private-squads/` (not published)
2. When ready, move to `squads/`
3. Add the squad to the `## Available Squads` table in this file
4. Add the squad to `package.json` `files`
5. Bump version and publish

## Release Guardrails

- `npm run validate:publish-surface` fails if a top-level squad is missing from `package.json` or this README
- `.github/workflows/sync-aiox-core.yml` opens or updates the `aiox-core` PR that advances the `pro` submodule
- Durante a transição do npm, o `aiox-core` ainda aceita o fallback legado `@aios-fullstack/pro` em ambientes já instalados
